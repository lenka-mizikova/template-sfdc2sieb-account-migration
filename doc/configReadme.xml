I want to synchronize accounts from Salesforce instance to Oracle Siebel Business Objects.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Salesfoce instance to Oracle Siebel Business Objects, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in the Siebel. 

As implemented, this Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided to Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Template will query SalesForce for all the existing Accounts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each Account will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching account in the Siebel and if the last updated date of the later is greater than the one of SalesForce.
The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create them in Siebel.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

In order to make the siebel connector work smoothly you have to provide the correct version of the siebel jars (Siebel.jar, SiebelJI_enu.jar) that works with your Siebel installation.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. This template uses just one query to Salesforce,
therefore this is not something to worry about.

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only a [HTTP Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

$H$H# Inbound Flow
**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateaccounts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

This file holds the functional aspect of the Anypoint Template, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the business logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just executes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing) which handles all its logic.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
